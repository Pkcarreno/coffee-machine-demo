# Coffee Machine Demo

Simple interactive web page built with Lit and no bundler. This is a basic demo for testing [@coffee-machine/core](https://github.com/Pkcarreno/coffeemachine), a small library I created for learning purposes. The page renders an interactive coffee simulator using web components.

## Built with

- **@coffee-machine/core** - Core coffee machine simulation logic
- **Lit** - Web components framework
- **Twind** - TailwindCSS alternative
